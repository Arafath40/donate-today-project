            <h1>OUR DONATION PLAN</h1>
            <p>We are careful about spending every bit that we receive.  Our team does elaborate work to identify areas that need attention, and our spending is based on this. We have a discipline on this subject and maintain proper records.  The following shows the spread of how we spend a rupee.</p>

                      We are doing our best to bring the marginalized specially-abled children into the mainstream to live a normal good life that they deserve.

                      <h2>shelter For family</h2>
                      Most of our children are from poor families and the poverty reduces their readiness for school and creates a barrier for their societal inclusion.

                      <h2>Education For child</h2>
                      At the Different Art Centre, the children are ensured of a specially crafted education in a healthy and well-maintained environment. DAC also provides daily meals to the children and their accompanying mothers.
